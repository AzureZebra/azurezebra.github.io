Welcome to my website!

I am still experimenting with how to use Github pages. So, this is in its preliminary phase.

# About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in the Oden Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.
I am majoring in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics, and my research focus is in the domain of computational materials science.
